um things up, 
AI solves tasks that require human intelligence, while ML is a subset of artificial intelligence that solves specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. 
This means that all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning. All machine learning falls under the AI umbrella.
But artificial intelligence is much more than only machine learning.
